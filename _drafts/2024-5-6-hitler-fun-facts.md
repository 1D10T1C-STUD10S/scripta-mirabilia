**Here are some facts about our favourite facsist dictator! (maybe not)**

### 1. His Dog, the first one
We all know that he had a dog, one given to him. It's name was Blondi and supposedly died with him via cyanide poisoning.\
However Hitler did have another dog before Blondi, Fuchsl. Fuchsl is a terrier that was caught by Hitler when he was in the trenches during WW1.\
Unfortunately, Fuchsl was 'kidnapped' and taken away.

### 2. Hitler was actually good at Art
Well, art is subjective. But I really can't deny the fact that Hitler was in fact good at art.\
Not how you would expect though, he was pretty good at drawing buildings, with some commenting that he would be a better architect. \
