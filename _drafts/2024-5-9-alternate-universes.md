## Overview

The theory of parallel universes often seemed like a wild fantasy when we were younger, now an impossible possibility.\
But Einstein's relativity may just prove that wrong. \
Then again... Maybe not...

Time to have a look...

## Definitions

Sit tight, this is quite a _big_ chunk of text...

### Light Cones

A light cone is a path of a flash of light, often from an observer's POV, that would show the direction of that said light's path through space-time in a 2D plane.

Since nothing travels faster than light, this light cone, would be the definition of what could happen to the observer and what the observer could influence.

Graphing the growing circle with the vertical axis of the graph representing time, the result is a cone.

### Black Holes

A black hole is a matter dense point in space time where the gravity is so strong, it _sucks_ space-time around it into itself.

Think of it this way.\
You have a very heavy metal ball, and you place it on a suspended piece of paper, the paper will _bend_ towards the ball. Just like how space-time _bends_ towards a black hole.

#### Event Horizons

A black hole has an event horizon, where it would take an object a speed faster than the speed of light to escape. Much like a waterfall, after a certain point you would need a great amount of velocity to flee the fall.

This was derived from the Schwarzchild Solution.

#### Singularity

A Singularity is the centre point of a black hole, where everything it absorbs will eventually approach.\
This point has an infinitely strong gravitational pull/force that makes it impossible to escape from.

Using the previous analagy, this is the bottom of the waterfall.

Found in the Schwarzschild Solution when radius = 0

#### Getting sucked into a Black Hole

In the event you ever cross the event horizon, you will start moving tow

### White Holes

These are hypothetical opposites of a black hole. When there's a negative, there's a positive. \
White Holes do quite literally the opposite of what Black Holes do. Instead of _pulling_ matter and photons in, they _push_ matter and photons out.\
Black holes will pull you to its centre, while white holes will push out away.

Sounds fun.

### The Penrose Diagram

Penrose diagrams are 2D diagrams showing relations in space-time.\
It shrinks/squeezes all of the obervable universe into a small space, light in this diagram will always travel at a 45 degrees angle.
