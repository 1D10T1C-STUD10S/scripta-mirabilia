## Definitions

### Light Cones

A light cone is a path of a flash of light, often from an observer's POV, that would show the direction of that said light's path through space-time in a 2D plane.

Since nothing travels faster than light, this light cone, would be the definition of what could happen to the observer and what the observer could influence.

Graphing the growing circle with the vertical axis of the graph representing time, the result is a cone.
