## Overview

Often times we associate 'evergreen' with 'conifer', however that might not be the case.\
Let's have a look shall we?

---

### Definitions:

**Evergreen**\
Evergreen essentially just means trees or shrubs that _do not_ shed their leaves during a certain period. Much unlike annual, biennial and perennial plants, that shed their leaves once every year, 2 years and 2< years respectively.

**Coniferous**\
Coniferous trees generically have needle-like leaves, can be classified as gymnosperms.\
The main characteristic that _all_ conifers have is that they reproduce via _cones_.

### Cases:
