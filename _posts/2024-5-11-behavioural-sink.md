## Overview

This term, 'behavioural sink' is uses to describe a collapse in behaviour during the overpopulation of a certain species.\
John B. Calhoun and his researchers conducted several experiments from 1958 - 1962, where several enclosures with some rats and unlimited resources to support population growth.

## Outcome

Eventually the population of these rats peaked and it was soon obvious that something was off...\
The rats began to show lack in social skills and there were fewer rats mating and as a result, breeding and reproducing. \
Females were also observed abandoning their young, and the whole rat population was going to self destruction.

## Explanation

If it wasn't obvious enough, overcrowding would definitely be a problem these rats faced, activities like feeding was associated with the company of other rats.\
The amount of social interaction each rat had to face in a small space would be overwhelming.

Just imagine, you are at a party, there's 50 people squeezed into one room, each person would not be able to avoid conversing or interacting with the other. \
It would drive you crazy...\
Unless you already are crazy.

## Conclusion

While we are worrying about what would happen if we become so numerous that the planet wouldn't be able to support out life, the opposite may not be any better.

Also if you are trapped in a room with 50 other people, please get out.

Don't torture yourself...
