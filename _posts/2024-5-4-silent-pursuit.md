## The Silent Hunter

The darkness was overwhelming. 

It swept like wildfire across the field from the woodland, leaving its ruthless trail of colourless wrath. 
I turned back to the expanse of towering, crooked trees. I swung forward. It didn't matter. I would get caught. He was coming now... Closer... Closer...

A soft rustling quiver of sound penetrated the air. Deafening. But soft. The thinned sound of rustling grew louder as a hulking figure pierced through the undergrowth, his ever searching eyes scanning the still field before him.

Everything held its breath. Everything, if it could breathe.

The figure held his weapon close to his chest, a large rifle. He held it close, hands gripping the trigger, threatening to fire.

I had to make a run for it...
So I did.

My hind legs ejected forward, sending me pummeling towards the foot of the small mound.
The figure hears. And he heard that...
