## Overview

For those who believe in the Big Bang Theory, the aftermath of such a big 'Bang' would be the start of many years of intrinsic expansion.

One way to know if the Universe is indeed expanding, would be to check for _redshift_. When an object is moving further away from you, it will appear redshifted, or reddish, as light will _'shift'_ towards a warmer spectrum.

However, if such a thing is _indeed_ happening, then maybe we should start worrying.

Here's why:

---

## Matter becomes diffuse

As the Universe expands, matter gets stretched along with it, its density would also decrease at the rate the Universe is expanding.

This would essentially mean that solids would break up into gasses or plasma.

I guess we will know what it's like to be a gas...

## The Big Rip

First we have the Big Bang, now we have the Big Rip...

This is a scenario where the expansion accelerates so quickly that it _tears_ all of space-time.

That would be an instant death. \
