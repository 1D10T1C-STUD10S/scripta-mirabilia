## Death's Diary

Well, dear reader, you have chanced upon a work of the one who was tasked to take you away, to whatever end you meet, it isn't _my_ fault. 

Remember that.

However I can't deny. I am the last one you'll see.\
If you happen to be on your death bed, I'll be waiting outside. Your _last_ moments are shared with _me_, not anyone else. 

Often times your fading soul will stare right into my _cold_, _empty_ face. \
Yes. I have a face.\
Not what most would expect though.

You mortals like to call yourselves _"creative"_ but I beg to differ. Which _creative_ intelligent species puts a skull on Death's face. \
Do tell.

I like to imagine my appearance as cold yet comforting.\
But I guess when you're given a job like this, _comforting_ is the last thing your _"victims"_ will call you.

In fact I will say it right now.\
You aren't _my_ victim, rather a _client_, I was _hired_ to transport you to the world beyond.\
Yet some crumble when they see me. *Crumble*. \
That's quite literally it. **Crumble**. 

It's painful. I know. \
I am a witness to many a tragic death. \

And I'll be a witness to mine, too.
