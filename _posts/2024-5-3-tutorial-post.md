1. You'll need to navigate to the repo for this site on Github, then go to `_posts` folder, you will see all the past posts already on there.

2. Create a new file and name it `*year*-*month*-*day*-*nameofpost*.md`, make sure it is under the folder `_posts`
   
3. You will need to put in the `layout, title, author and tags` parameters before continuing.
   
   - Follow the template for the parameters:

  ```
      ---
     
      layout: post #required
     
      title: "*post title, can be anything*" #required
     
      author: "*your name*" #required
     
      tags: #eg. 'story' for story posts
     
      ---
  ```

4. Now you can add in the contents of your post in Markdown, HTML is also supported.
   
5. Finally, press 'commit changes' and wait for Github to serve it onto the site.
   
6. You're done! You can now view the post on the site itself!
