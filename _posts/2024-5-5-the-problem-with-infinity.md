# The Problem with Infinity

We all know what the infinity sign(âˆž) means. 

_'a number greater than any assignable quantity or countable number'_ 
> dictionary definition
r
However, if you _were_, in actual fact, to treat it as a number, you'll find that this unobtainable quantity is harder to fathom than you'd expect.


### Picture this:

There is a hotel, with an infinite capacity. \
This hotel had 1 guest, no problem imagining that, right? \
Now, there are an infinite amount of guests entering that hotel.

**Does the hotel have enough capacity for all the guests?**

Let's look back at the definition. \
_'a number greater than any assignable quantity or countable number'_ \
Therefore `infinity + 1` is still equal to infinity.

Good so far?


Now. Say this hotel had a elevator to access all the infinite floors.\
The infinite guests have to fit into this (finite) elevator, there wouldn't be an end, would there? \
The elevator will have to climb the infinite floors and serve the infinite guests.


**Let's go further shall we?**

The definition of infinity is _'a number greater'_ when a new floor is reached by the elevator, that floor could be _counted_ then the floor above _is_ the _'number greater'_.

If that's the case, we would _**never, ever**_ reach infinity.
