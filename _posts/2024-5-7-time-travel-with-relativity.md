### Overview

The theory of relativity revoles around the relationship between 'space-time'.\
We have both 'general relativity' and 'special relativity',

### General Relativity

In general relativity, gravity is not described as a force, but rather a dimple or bump in space-time, this would mean matter-dense black holes and stars could theoratically be gateways to timetravel.

This is described as CTC, Closed Timelike Curves, acting like loops back in time.\
However, probably no one in the right mind would lauch themselves into a matter-dense star or black hole. (_Right?_)

### Special Relativity

Special relativity proves how we can travel _forward_ in time. \
One concept of this is 'time dilation' this refers to time being _slower_ or _faster_ depending on the viewers motion or position. 

Here is a small GIF to help visualise:

When an object moves at a high speed relative to an observer, time appears to move slower for the fast-moving object compared to the observer. 

With this, we can conclude that if a person were to be travelling at high speeds, (close to that of the speed of light) time _relative_ to you would be _faster_.
