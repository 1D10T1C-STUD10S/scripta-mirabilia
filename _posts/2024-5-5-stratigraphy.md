# Stratigraphy

Stratigraphy is the study of rock layers, known as 'strata',these rocks are usually sedimetary, (with layers and are crumbly).

### Lithostratigraphy

The most basic form of stratigraphy, studying the _layers_ of strata, using the law of superposition (older rocks below).

### Biostratigraphy

Biostratigraphy involves using the layers of rocks and fossils within them. Fossil fauna and flora in the same layers across different locations can be assumed to be of the same time period. \
Methods like this were replaced by other ways of checking time periods (radiometric dating) which lead to chronostratigraphy.

### Chemostratigraphy

Quite literally, the study of the chemical compsition in the strata. These data can then be used to compare between layers of strata. \
The metal, carbon content of the rocks may differ based on the strata tested.
