**Here are some facts about our favourite facsist dictator! (maybe not)**

---

### 1. His Dog, the first one
We all know that he had a dog, one given to him. It's name was Blondi and supposedly died with him via cyanide poisoning.\
However Hitler did have another dog before Blondi, Fuchsl. Fuchsl is a terrier that was caught by Hitler when he was in the trenches during WW1.\
Unfortunately, Fuchsl was 'kidnapped' and taken away.

### 2. Hitler was actually good at Art
Well, art is subjective. But I really can't deny the fact that Hitler was in fact good at art.\
Not how you would expect though, he was pretty good at drawing buildings, with some commenting that he would be a better architect. \
View his art [here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paintings_by_Adolf_Hitler).

### 3. His unique moustache isn't that unique
If Hitler was known for one thing, it would probably be his iconic moustache.\
But the squarish moustache is actually because of WW1. You see, in WW1 gasses like mustard gas was used to clear places like trenches. \
To prevent that, gas masks were given out to troops, Hitler, who fought in WW1 had a very much different moustache compared to the one he is known for.\
The one he has now (or the one he _had_) is a result of him trimming off the edges to allow the gas mask to fit on his face. See his old moustache [here](https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/images_blogs/photos/uncategorized/2007/05/07/whitler06.jpg).
